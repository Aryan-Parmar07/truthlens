## 🚀 Overview

**TruthLens** is a frontend prototype for a SaaS platform designed to verify digital media authenticity. It simulates advanced forensic analysis to detect deepfakes in video and audio using biometric analysis and artifact detection.

Key innovations include a **Client-Side Computer Vision Engine** that performs real-time motion heat-mapping directly in the browser to verify liveness without a heavy backend.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🎥 Live Liveness Detection:** Uses browser-based computer vision (Canvas API) to generate real-time motion heatmaps, proving the video feed is live and not a pre-recorded injection.
* **🕵️‍♂️ Forensic Analysis Simulation:** visually impressive scanning states with frame-by-frame artifact detection simulation.
* **📊 Enterprise Dashboard:** "Linear-style" UI with dark mode, glassmorphism, and interactive data visualization using Recharts.
* **⌨️ Command Palette:** Fully functional `Cmd+K` interface for rapid navigation.
* **🛡️ Trust Watermarking:** Toggleable cryptographic visual seal for verified media.
* **🎨 Premium UI/UX:** Built with a custom particle background engine and high-performance Framer Motion animations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
